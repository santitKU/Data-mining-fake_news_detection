# Streamlit Deployment

Streamlit as a versatile Python library tailored for crafting dynamic web applications, especially handy for data science and machine learning projects. With Streamlit, we empower developers to effortlessly construct interactive user interfaces directly from Python scripts, eliminating the need for extensive knowledge of web development technologies like HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. Its user-friendly nature enables us to swiftly create data visualization dashboards, prototype machine learning models, and seamlessly share our work with collaborators. Streamlit's simplicity and efficiency make it a preferred tool among data scientists and developers for rapidly deploying and disseminating projects.

This project is deployed on Streamlit app. To run the app run the following command

`streamlit run detect2.py`
